### Enable AWS S3
Put `access-id` and `access-key` under `~/.aws/credentials`. `access-id` and `access-key` can
be found at vocareum -> workbench -> account details. The `access-id` and `access-key` expires 
after 3 hours.  
Make sure the bucket has the policy that allows public access to every object in this
bucket.
